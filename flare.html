    <h1>Creative flare through buttons and dropdowns</h1>
    <p style="color: black">There are several things that I can do to add some creative flare to make a website look unique.
    You have probably already noticed a few in the website such as the fixed navigation bar above and the fact that the
    background remains fixed while everything else seems to glide over it. Below are a few more examples of things not
    already present in this website.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color: black">Unique Buttons</h2>
    <br>
    <p style="color: black">Any picture can become a button with a few extra lines of html. Which makes the visitor's experience more
        personal and unique.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <h1><a href="index.html"><img src="images/me.jpg" height="25%" width="25%"></a></h1>
                <p style="color: black">Click on me to return to the home page</p>
            </td>
            <td>
                <h1><a href = "mailto: thekaz85@gmail.com?subject=Website inquery"><img src="images/envelope.png" height="15%" width="15%"></a></h1>
                <p style="color: black">Or you can click on this envelope to send me an email</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <h1><a href="tel:9282354522"><img src="images/phone.png" alt="Call 9282354522" height="10%" width="10%"/></a></h1>
    <p style="color: black; text-align: center">Clicking on the phone will open the call app with my phone number, feel free to call. I look forward to your call</p>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color: black">Dropdowns and Reactive links</h2>
    <div class="menu">
        <p style="color: black; text-align: center">Just about anything can be put into a dropdown. Hover over this text to see.</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>From text like this for showing and hiding information quickly</li>
        <li>To links like <a href="index.html">this to send you back to home</a></li>
        <li>Or maybe pictures?</li>
        <li><img src="images/me.jpg" height="25%" width="25%"></li>
        <li>Working together the possibilities are endless. If you can imagine it then I can do it. If not now than I will learn to do it in the future.</li>
