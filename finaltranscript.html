        MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Md. — Several residents voiced health concerns over pending 5G towers in their community at a public meeting today. 
Dozens of residents attended the meeting expressed opposition to the 5G towers and demanded that more research be conducted regarding the potential health effects of Radio Frequency (RF) radiation from 5G emissions. 
5G towers are wireless transmitters that use high-frequency radio waves to deliver faster and more reliable internet services than previous generations.
Mitsuko Herrera, who is the councilwoman in charge of technology projects in Montgomery County, hosted the meeting.  
Andrew Afflerbach Ph.D., the CEO for CTC energy and Technology, Gerard Lederer, an outside telecom legal advisor, and Joy Nurmi, representing county executive David Leggett, were also present. 
These three frequently supported Herrera during the open comment section of the meeting on expert matters such as health and safety concerns prompted by the potential for wireless radiation. They also explained that residents cannot refuse the service.
Some residents suggested a moratorium on the construction of 5G towers until more research is done on the health effects of exposure to 5G emissions. Montgomery County locals expressed a distrust for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and demanded that another organization conduct the research.
By the end of the meeting many residents remained unconvinced that the council's strategy to place the towers 20 feet above ground would be enough to keep them safe from harmful radiation.
At the start of the meeting, Herrera delivered a presentation outlining Montgomery County’s plan to ensure the health of people living near 5G towers.
Herrera wanted the meeting to address the residents’ health concerns, not whether the county would allow the towers to be installed. 
“…we cannot simply say we do not want these services.” Herrera stated, referring to the law that makes prohibiting the provision of  internet services illegal.  
Councilwoman Herrera pointed out that plan for the towers does comply with the FCC standards for safe emissions. 
Regarding the FCC, Herrera informed everyone that, “they have told us informally that they think that their current standards are still good.”
The residents questioned whether the access points would be enough to protect them from harm. They cited studies that have shown a link between exposure to RF radiation and cancer. 
Montgomery resident Bob Solow, a retired Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) scientist, stated, “I strongly believe … low-level frequency of radiation can cause DNA damage or … brain cancer, [or] leukemia in children.” 
Most of the residents pointed to a lack of science to back up Herrera’s plan. Residents repeatedly stated that they wanted the county to spend more time to study the issue.
Unconvinced that the FCC standards for RF emissions are safe, some residents said that they did not want the access points to be installed.
Gerard Lederer explained that “if you say no that’s … a violation of the prohibiting of the provision of service.”
Joy Nuri supported this claim saying, “I think a lot of people making the mistake that if it goes through a conditional use that it will be turned down and that that isn't necessarily correct.”
Residents expressed their concerns about Montgomery County’s lack of transparency. They wanted more information from experts about the safety of 5G RF radiation.
Herrera adjourned the meeting at the two-hour mark. She then instructed residents to go on Facebook and look for a link to a website where a video of the meeting would be posted. 
This is the fourth meeting about this project. This meeting, as well as others in the series, can be found on the county’s official Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/MontgomeryCountyMdCouncil.

        9:05
hi welcome welcome everybody thank you for joining us tonight thank you for
9:10
coming to the forth community meeting hosted by the county executive to get community input on a draft zoning text
9:18
amendment to address deployment of small antennas in our community my name is Mitsouko Herrera I am the
9:25
ultra Montgomery program director and I handle policy planning and special
9:31
technology projects with me tonight we have joiner me who is special assistant
9:37
to County Executive Isiah Leggett Jerry letterer who is our outside legal
9:43
counsel from best best and Krieger on telecommunications issues and Andrew F'lar back who is the CEO and director
9:51
of engineering for CTC energy and Technology who are engineering
9:56
consultants for us I want to thank you all for coming out I know that there's a football game that's starting this
10:02
evening so I appreciate you taking your time I know that there's some of you at home there doing that we are planning to
10:08
go live tonight from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m. so we will have a hard stop the the the
10:15
video of the meeting will be available we are also streaming live on the internet Facebook and YouTube so what
10:23
we'd like to do for tonight's meeting if we could go to the PowerPoint slide deck that is going to appear on this screen
10:31
what I'd like to do is to give a brief update answer and then try to hold the
10:39
bulk of the meeting to answer resident questions and what we're gonna do is have you raise your hand because we are
10:45
recording this you need to wait until susan kenedy who's our host and is gonna
10:51
come to you and she's gonna hold the microphone so that we get good sound and the people at home and later can hear
10:56
your question and then we may at certain points depending on how it goes ask for people who may have questions in the
11:03
same topic so that we can kind of try to handle address different issues as they come up okay so with that if we have the
11:11
PowerPoint okay so I think that's what
11:16
we're going to next slide okay first thing is under federal law I think
11:22
this is an important parameter for people to understand that under federal law the county may not have the effect
11:30
of prohibiting the provision of service so what that means is that we cannot
11:37
simply say we do not want these services that is sort of the outer limit we are
11:43
allowed to do zoning that can we just keep the PowerPoint up for me thank you so the second is that the is that the
11:54
county's transmission facilities coordinating group or what we sometimes call the tower committee or the tfcg
12:01
enforces the current FCC standards about radio frequency emissions there are
12:09
current standards and for every application that comes through the county we determine whether they are
12:15
complying with the current standards however the under federal law the county
12:23
may not deny or create zoning regulations on the basis of concerns
12:32
about the health effects of RF emissions under federal law we can enforce the FCC
12:39
the rules the FCC creates but we cannot create our own rules and third the
12:47
county executive believes that the RF emissions is an issue that is worth
12:53
investigating the FCC enacted the current standards in 1996 in 2013 they
13:02
opened up a new proceeding to see whether those rules needed updating and primarily what they were looking at is
13:09
because you had a deployment of lots of these things on the roof and you had people that got closer than a meter to
13:15
them they wanted to look at those standards the FCC has not completed that
13:21
work they have told us informally that they think that their current standards are still good and we have said to them
13:27
if that's the case then you should complete the proceeding County Executive Council member reamer
13:33
representative Raskin and representatives from all of our congressional delegation met with the
13:39
chairman of the FCC and told him the most important thing that you can do to help public acceptance of this new
13:47
technology is to complete your proceeding and address people's concerns about RF but for the county we can
13:55
enforce those rules but we cannot Zone on the basis of it next slide all right this slide here is a map of
14:04
the United States those are all the states that have enacted legislation to
14:11
preempt local authority to address zoning of small antennas you know hi oh
14:18
it was overturned because it was part of a petshop bill and in California the
14:24
governor vetoed it but what you'll see is that what we believe in montgomery
14:30
county is that a local solution is better than state or federal preemption
14:35
and we are very concerned that the FCC has opened up three different
14:42
proceedings to look at ways that they can preempt local government Congress
14:47
has enacted a shot clock and said and this was a piece of legislation that was
14:52
added to the middle-class tax relief act saying there's plenty of room if you want to come on in saying that where we
15:00
have modifications that we have to approve those the FCC has added shot clocks of 60 90 and a hundred and fifty
15:08
days so in the same way that in the 1990s we updated our zoning code to
15:14
address very tall macro towers what we are trying to do now is to address and
15:21
come up with rules that protect our neighborhoods and do our best to have that these new antennas are compatible
15:28
in the neighborhoods at the same time meeting the shot clocks and ensuring
15:35
that we are not pre-empting the provision of service next slide there's
15:42
an update for those of you on the outside and they're also posted on the county's website on Friday senator
15:49
wicker from Mississippi and senator Cortes Masto from Nevada introduced a
15:57
piece of legislation which would preempt all local zoning for environmental protection review now that's not going
16:04
so far as to preempt but this idea that there's not an ability to create enough
16:11
consensus at the local level and therefore we should preempt is something that we are working to come up with a
16:18
local solution and we would like to have that Montgomery County model be a model that could be used in other areas
16:23
throughout Maryland and the region we plan into instead in addition the
16:29
Federal Communications Commission created a broadband deployment Advisory Committee I will tell you that in that
16:35
proceeding when they set it up initially they had two people from local government they were asked to create a
16:41
model ordinance and there is nobody on the committee who actually has
16:46
experience drafting local ordinances so we are fighting that as well and we are
16:52
hoping that we can come up with something at the Montgomery County level that we can then say and say this is a
16:57
good thing to look in other places across the nation so next slide all
17:03
right so in July we released a draft zoning
17:09
and I will tell you this that zoning is complicated it is not that easy to
17:15
understand there are lots of implications and lots of moving parts
17:20
and for those of you who feel a little bit frustrated about you know this is very difficult I understand because
17:27
zoning is not something that I really knew much about before I started this so
17:32
we are trying our best to get through some of the text and then to create other materials that help people
17:37
understand the gist of what we're working on to provide enough detail but not so much that you just kind of throw
17:44
your hands up alright what we're suggesting what we suggested in July is that within the right-of-way we have and
17:51
and also four parking lot lights we have street lights we have utility poles we have parking lot lights those are
17:57
electrified structure those are the kinds of areas that the providers are coming to us and they are
18:02
asking to be able to deploy equipment so in order to meet those shot clocks what we are looking to do is to create some
18:09
bright-line rules that you can say yes you meet these conditions in which case
18:15
those can be a limited use the limited use means that they go to the tower
18:21
committee for an engineering review they go to building permits for safety compliance they do not have a public
18:27
hearing the public hearing would be reserved for conditional use and those are for cases in which there's some
18:34
discretion so it isn't a matter of yes I met this condition it's a matter of well
18:40
does it kind of fit in and that's what you would use a hearing examiner for at
18:45
the office of Zoning and administrative appeals but for the limited use what we're trying to do is to move through
18:51
that in that process and so that we have a manageable way of doing it well we
18:57
looked at doing or is to say that the replacement call polls could have an extra five to ten feet depending on the
19:02
width of the road we looked at lowering the height that antennas could be placed
19:08
on so that we would provide alternative locations for collocations so you'd have less of a need in some cases to put it
19:15
in a neighborhood because you could put it on a bank branch for example you
19:20
could put it on a very large grocery store that's only one story so we're
19:26
just the same way that in the 90s what we said is if you co-locate on an
19:31
existing structure that's a limited use and you don't need a zoning hearing but
19:36
we said if you want to add something new that would be a conditional use and it would still go through the zoning
19:41
hearing okay so what we would also do is we would keep the conditional use process so if you can't replace
19:48
something that's existing and you can't attach to something that's existing there is an option for you to continue
19:55
to go for a provider to go and get a conditional use hearing at that point there would be a public hearing the
20:02
office of Zoning and administrative hearings would send notice of the application and you have an opportunity to come in and and testify
20:09
all right next slide ok so these are the changes on I think I
20:17
have two or three slides and then we're going to open it up for questions okay so we set out front is a copy of the
20:24
October draft of the zoning text there's nothing that shows you the changes
20:30
between October and July what we're sort of focused on is this is the current
20:37
version of where we're at when you read that document the brackets designate things that should be deleted from the
20:43
existing code and the underlined shows you things that would be new additions to the code so there was concern one of
20:53
the things that we were concerned about is that if you're in a neighborhood in which the street lights are owned let me
20:59
also mention none of this change is the underlying requirement that you have to have the property owner's permission so
21:07
if you want to replace a pole you want to attach to a pole you want to attach to a building the building owner the
21:13
pole owner has to provide permission so there could be cases where in about half
21:21
the county and it's mostly up County the utilities are all underground so there
21:28
is no aerial telephone poles that you can connect to and instead you would
21:34
either have to replace a streetlight but if you couldn't get permission from the owner of the streetlight so for example
21:40
an association may own that and you might have to go and get a conditional use and in that conditional use the way
21:48
that the code currently reads is that it has to be set back 300 feet from the property line the problem is if you are
21:54
using an existing streetlight and replacing it with something slightly taller there's almost nothing that's going to be 300 feet back so what we
22:02
wanted was to be able to have a small instance where these shorter poles could be used but the intention was not to
22:09
allow taller towers so what we did is we changed that we in July we had said that
22:15
we would eliminate the 300 foot setback and now what we said we retain that 300 foot setback and you'll see that there's
22:21
language in there that says instead is that we would go ahead and we would add
22:26
a small exception so that if it is on 35 feet or shorter the setback is one to
22:33
one from a dwelling so it would still have to be for every foot of height of the pole set back from the dwelling at
22:40
least that many feet the second thing that we did is under the current zoning
22:48
is when you're using an existing structure so now I might have replaced something and it's taller it can hold
22:54
more antennas or might have a utility pole and I want to attach antennas to that for that these antennas you could
23:02
only you could use that pole the antennas would have to be set back at least 20 feet from an existing dwelling
23:08
in a residential area and at least ten feet in a commercial or multi-unit area
23:14
and the reason for that difference is is that where we've built in places like Silver Spring the the the buildings are
23:22
much closer to the street and it really doesn't exist twenty feet between where the poles are and where any of the new
23:28
buildings are coming and then what we've also did is previously in the in the
23:34
1990s we had references to WIPP antennas and directional antennas and now there's
23:39
a bunch of different kinds of antennas and they're going to be new antennas because even though people talk about 5g
23:46
and small cell small cell is a meaningless marketing term it doesn't
23:51
actually mean anything specific which is why we sometimes use smaller antennas
23:57
micro towers the problem is if you're searching for for small cell we we try and we're trying to address that but in
24:04
those cases if you can go back for a moment we handed up with all these different sizes so what we did instead
24:10
is that in the draft you see now is that we simply replace them with five categories in which there is a maximum
24:17
size length and there is a maximum volume and that's what we intend to
24:23
capture so whether you use a different kind of technology the 5g standards that those standards are going to be coming
24:30
out in March of this year so there's going to be a lot of change and there's a lot of equipment manufacturers who are
24:36
looking to design and build things which is partly why we want to have these standards so that we can have
24:42
things that the industry is trying to meet all right next slide okay
24:49
in the July draft what we had said is if you have poles that are shorter than 20
24:55
feet the equipment had to be in the base and if you had poles that were taller it could be on top of the equipment or it
25:02
could be in the base and after some discussion this the recommendation was is that we require that all the
25:09
equipment be in the base or at ground level or it could be stealth the the
25:17
issue there is that in order to have equipment at the ground level
25:22
it cannot be technologically it cannot be air-cooled because it one it doesn't
25:28
get enough circulation and two you generally have to do more things to harden the equipment at ground level in
25:34
case somebody comes along and wants to kick it those kinds of things so a fan is permitted but it would have to meet
25:40
the requirements of the noise ordinance and we would review the noise ordinance to see if there's anything in addition
25:46
specifically to these types of things that needs to be added then we also
25:52
added that graffiti needed to be removed and damage repaired there was an issue about who was the tower owner in the
25:58
antenna but what we're really trying to get at is to make sure is if you put it up you got to make sure that it continues to look nice all right
26:05
the replacement poles and the additional height an issue that came up is that
26:10
utility poles that have electrical lines on them there are minimum distances that
26:16
you need to have for those lines in order to meet safety standards another
26:22
issue is that you want to avoid some situations where you might have somebody going out a worker in a bucket truck and
26:27
you don't want to necessarily have to have them climbing over having to get too close to electrified things to get
26:33
to telecom things so what we generally said is if you're looking at a utility
26:38
pole you can have an additional 10 feet now we look there some utility poles
26:44
that are very large in the county so we think that 10 should cover it in all situations in a parking lot where you
26:50
have those lights we also said you could have an additional 10 up to ten feet for the streetlights in most
26:58
neighborhoods where you have a paved width of the road that's 30 feet or less
27:03
you can have an additional five feet in some cases where you have at least three
27:10
or four lanes and the road width the paved surface is between thirty and sixty feet for those ones you could have
27:17
an additional ten feet and there are some places in the county like great Seneca Highway where you'll have a five
27:23
or six lane road in those situations you need more height because one you need to
27:28
have the antennas so that any kinds of passing trucks it's taller than those things and you also want to be able to
27:35
get the antenna to go from both sides of the street so in those limited cases there's an additional 20 feet but those
27:42
again are going to be very large things they typically have no houses abutting them last thing I'll say is that on this
27:48
piece is that in most cases in the streetlights streetlights are almost always roughly two sizes you either got the colonial post in a
27:57
neighborhood and it's going to be 14 feet tall or you might have a cantilever cobrahead style or taller bronze ones
28:04
most of those ones are roughly about 27 feet all right and if we can look at the slides one more thing then the last
28:12
thing on here is there's a lot of discussion about how do we have community input and people's and
28:19
residences and yet still managed to meet the shot clock so one of the things that
28:25
we're looking at is that the application system is going to be going online so
28:30
what we're hoping to do one is to if you want to register I'm gonna probably be within an HOA area it would be an
28:37
automatic trigger so if something comes in in this geographic area if you're registered it would send notice saying
28:42
something has come in in this area well we're also doing is having in those applications is having more information
28:49
that the providers give us explaining why did you pick that particular site
28:55
because in some of these cases sometimes it's engineering sometimes it can be I wanted to move it outside of the ideally
29:01
I would have put it in the coldest act but I put it on this road because it was on the backside of people's houses and there was an open space across the
29:07
street but for whatever those things are we think that's useful information for people to understand and if we can look at the
29:12
slides I think that that might be I look at the next one and okay
29:21
and yeah we go okay so we're done with slides so in the slide deck well I have
29:27
other slides that we can we're gonna try to figure out if we need them for examples but with that we're gonna go
29:33
ahead and we're going to turn it over for questions what again remind you is that you need to wait for Susan to come with you to
29:40
the mic and I like to hope that you know as people in Montgomery County that we will all try to be respectful of each
29:46
other please try not to talk over other people and we'll try to let everybody finish but it will ask you to please try
29:52
to keep your questions short so that we can get to as many as we can tonight all right let's see a hand okay yes
30:02
ma'am okay oh sorry one more thing if
30:11
you would please say your name because when we go back and we post the video
30:16
what we will try to do is to put your name if we can figure out the proper spelling so that people can identify who
30:22
that is speaking hi my name is Kate Kiel this is just a legal question and I
30:30
presume it's for the gentleman up there what two questions what constitutes
30:36
service when we are told that we cannot prevent telecom service what is the
30:43
definition that's used legally in that document and what doc what law is that
30:51
from that's question number one and question number two is in the
30:57
Telecommunications Act of 1996 is it
31:03
pre-empting the construct objecting to
31:08
cell towers on the grounds of two cell towers being erected or is it objecting
31:16
on the grounds of Spahn health that you or environment you cannot object to
31:21
cell towers being erected on the grounds of environmental health environmental
31:27
effects which has been interpreted to mean health
31:33
does that include operating the towers or may we object legally to operating
31:42
the towers on the grounds of health okay so this is Jerry letterer our outside
31:49
counsel know so it's it's
32:02
counterintuitive red means that it's on it's a it's a warning watch what you say
32:08
yes so Kate both terrific questions you can find the standard for the
32:15
prohibition or the effective prohibition of service in 47 USC 332 C 7 so
32:23
basically that section talks about five it says we can't do that and then it
32:29
says that there are five areas that we have to follow if we want to preserve our zoning Authority and our management
32:36
authority the last one of those has to do with our F and as you know miss
32:42
Herrera pointed out in the presentation a great frustration for us at the local government level is that we cannot deny
32:49
because of our F well the most that we can do is we can demand that there be
32:54
compliance with the RF standards in our community this county makes a significant investment in having an
33:01
outside engineering firm CTC in fact check that and then on occasions also go
33:06
back and check to make sure that they're in compliance on an operating basis so we think that we're doing the maximum of
33:13
what we can do today under the law now I want to be very very candid with you 332
33:21
C 7 doesn't say anything more than MIT's he said you asked the better question and what does that really mean and the
33:27
answer is you there are there are a number of circuit courts around the country right so in the federal system
33:34
you have a try Court and then it goes up to a Circuit Court of Appeal that's where a lot of
33:39
times the law has made the interpretation of the statute comes out there are conflicting definitions of
33:46
what that means I think everybody agrees though that if you say no you can't
33:51
build any that's going to be found to be a violation of the prohibiting of the
33:57
provision of service I'm more than happy Kate - we have a PowerPoint presentation
34:02
that my firm does it lists the different circuit courts and what they've said about what is it is not a limitation of
34:10
the provision of service and I'll get your email afterwards and more than happy to send you that page I wasn't
34:17
clear as to whether that prohibition prohibits the erection of towers on the
34:27
grounds of environmental effects or whether it prohibits the operation I
34:34
apologize I immediately jumped in to read environmental to mean to you
34:39
RF when it could be a number of other things that my fault yes we can impose we can enforce
34:47
environmental laws both NEPA which is the National Environmental Protection Act as well as any of our
34:55
state laws so long as those state local laws do not arise to the level of
35:00
prohibiting the provision of services so we don't have carte blanche to come up with any rule that we want I mean the
35:07
courts will look at it with it with a bit of a I don't I say cynical eye but certainly a probing eye to see whether
35:14
or not the environmental standard we've established is really a way to bar the the the construction the deployment of
35:21
the tower and the services that it would make possible okay to your specific
35:27
questions and I believe that we have later in the PowerPoint and we can release that the statute itself says
35:34
that we may not regulate on the basis of the health effects of radiofrequency emissions so whether we are regulating
35:42
on the basis of what can be zoned or whether that can be operated they both
35:47
likely fall on that same category okay I'm gonna thank you for your question
35:53
and I'm gonna take one right behind you
36:01
mine is Bob Solow on I am a resident of Montgomery County for the last thirty years Susan Susan Hall does allow Susan
36:09
to hold the microphone now we shall hold it in a spot that we get the best audio I'm an environmental scientist retired
36:17
from EPA and ice made this statement about a year back I'm still concerned I know you've said about the health
36:23
effects cannot be debated basically I strongly believe based upon the current
36:29
scientific evidence and more accumulating evidence coming up that the
36:35
low level frequency of radiation can cause DNA damage cancer or clearly brain
36:43
cancer leukemia in children I do not think we should neglect the fact we
36:48
should be fighting with the FCC FCC is not an again I'll repeat NOT a health
36:54
agency is not an IH it's not EPA who makes evaluation of this take Sam I am
37:02
tired of hearing this that we cannot fight this at a congressional level again again I've been saying this we
37:10
need to wake up and protect these a the children as well as protect the citizens
37:16
of the Montgomery County thank you okay if I could ask if we could go to slide
37:25
18 and then I want to have Andrew ephra back answer that question address that
37:31
comment so to the point of the FCC and
37:37
not being a health agency I think you know I can't really speak to that in
37:42
particular what I mean other than that obviously it as its own mandate for what it is we did an analysis as requested by
37:51
the county to look at comparing the RF emission from both the proposed small
37:58
cell locations that we have actually received locations four and then one that was sort of cranked up to what we would
38:06
imagine would be a worst-case scenario which would be taking that cell site and then putting up three more antennas in
38:14
three different bands at the same location and then multiplying the power by another factor of ten for each one of
38:20
those by putting up a a very directional antenna and then pointing it at a house and the idea is to to try to look at we
38:29
get the slide deck up yes thank you the
38:35
idea is to answer a quick n't we couldn't really address the question what is in this what is the long term
38:42
effect what is where all these other diseases and so forth that's not kind of where we can act but what we did is
38:48
compare it is something that people work with and understand so for example microwave oven a cell phone and so the
38:56
example was if you had a cell phone there was three inches away from you how far away would you have to place one of
39:03
these small cell sites to get the equivalent amount the answer was for the
39:08
first case the one where we did get an application and and that was approved as 2.3 feet so in other words for the same
39:17
energy that you would have for holding your phone like this it would have to be a 2.3 feet to get the same level from
39:24
the small cell site going back to the other example I mentioned which is okay
39:29
suppose you had three different companies putting antennas on and then you multiplied by ten the power of those
39:34
by by putting on a directional antenna and then pointing it directly into a particular direction someone's house
39:40
perhaps so the answer for that is nine feet essentially to get that equivalence
39:47
or so even in that case if you pointed all that in one direction all that radiation is essentially 10 feet away
39:56
again to reach the equivalence of a cell phone that you're using so we also
40:02
compared like I said to the microwave oven so instead of 9 feet it's it's 10.5
40:07
feet would be the equivalence with the cell phone herbs are with a microwave oven of
40:13
this again the very high power site so that's it was the idea was to sort of
40:19
see where are we with some of the distances that we're looking at some of the proposed ZTA rules in terms of
40:26
safety and so again compared to what we're looking at here that's the distances we're looking at in
40:32
addition to what massara is talking about there's also as she mentions a
40:38
review that goes with every single one of these applications for compliance with the FCC rules so that's with the
40:45
current FCC rules and then as you're saying Mitsy that hopefully there's a
40:50
review that's going to continue in the FCC and then it would be with whatever subsequent FCC rules exists with regard
40:59
to this yeah for a number of folks that are here for the first time just like to
41:05
take a half-second Mitzi mentioned it in her presentation you've heard us talk about this in the past but for folks
41:12
that are here for the first time you need to know that the county executive
41:17
congressman Raskin councilman reamer and a representative of every single one of
41:25
our Senate and House offices spent a day at the Commission with pretty much the I
41:33
won't say the single but certainly the primary message to be that the RF standards need to be updated and so I
41:41
can understand every bit of frustration that might be expressed on RF tonight I
41:46
just simply need to tell you that the elected leadership of the county is
41:51
doing everything it can to try to have those updated and and I and I could give
41:58
you the the site where you can pull up where we at the FCC if you meet you have to file something called an ex parte de
42:04
letter which documents for everyone that you've been there who was there who you met with and what you talked about and
42:10
I'm more than happy to get you a copy that ex parte de letter which outlines in detail that it was the leading issue
42:16
that the county executive raised over and over and over again with all five
42:21
commissioners the Chairman okay yeah that if you go to the and the antenna of
42:27
ZTA site there is a section on there about radiofrequency emissions a summary
42:32
of all those meetings there is a memo from the county executive to the community that is on there and the
42:38
various letters that were sent in and that have been filed are also there so let me before I come back down in front
42:43
are there other RF questions okay so let's sort of take them in the back in
42:50
the blue sweater yes yes ma'am wait for the mic
43:00
I'm Stephanie link and um I have a friend Lisa who she has the
43:07
electromagnetic hypersensitivity and the when you were talking about the cellphones and the microwave she doesn't
43:17
have a cell phone or a microwave in her home beak and she can choose to do that
43:22
but she won't be able to choose if there's a cell phone you know close to
43:28
her house she can't keep it out of her house so I guess I would say how are you
43:34
gonna help those people are is there a possibility of having some RF free safe
43:43
zones in the county or something so much so there so a couple things first is is
43:51
that one thing to also remember is that within your phone for those of you who remember the shoebox iPhone or the flip
43:58
phone where you had to pull out the little antenna your phone itself has an antenna and actually the better your
44:06
signal is the less the less your phone has to work and so the RF within your
44:12
phone is actually less there isn't a realistic possibility of creating RF
44:19
free zones because a there's a lot of stuff out there and B there are gonna be other people who want to have their cell
44:26
phone work I think the county can look at it on a case-by-case basis because
44:31
there's other things there can be people that are delivering packages that come to your house and they have a cell phone
44:36
signal and they have an electronic thing that you've got to sign that's going
44:41
back so there's other things besides these I'm sure that County in lots of different ways there can be things where
44:48
we have these kinds of unique health things to try to figure out what can be done but in general it's not feasible to
44:56
say that we'll just have areas of the county where cell phones don't work next
45:01
question Donna Barron
45:07
just-just on though these are just the RF I'm we're trying to get a couple more of these and then Thank You Donna Baron
45:21
I was interested in the way you said the way you checked it and that would be
45:28
from the tower into a house so you're saying for the people in the house it
45:35
would what it would be for them right so on our neighborhood in our neighborhood
45:42
there are a lot of people who walk we have to walk in the streets because the developer was not required to put in
45:49
sidewalks that's another issue so we don't have time for tonight
45:55
nope not sidewalks tonight so but at any rate so wheat less that's on Saturday I
46:02
drove about a mile in our neighborhood and there were at least 15 people with
46:08
their dogs and kids walking along the street so the problem is and the
46:14
question that I have is are we collecting all of this rrf because as
46:22
most people here know our neighborhood is scheduled to get 13 cell towers
46:29
everybody else gets to but we're special we get 13 so as we
46:34
walk around through our neighborhood are we collecting that RF radiation from all
46:40
those 13 towers so I think that's that's a really good question because we we
46:47
were mostly thinking about the case of what you're pointing at a house and we want to be concerned about someone who's
46:52
in their room or whatever there but so it's the same thing in all directions potentially and so that's why the height
46:59
rules that are in fact here are also considering people who are walking by or
47:05
people who are right near come near by so again if the we're talking about a 3
47:12
a 3 foot or 2.3 foot rather relative to a cell phone and so if a radio itself is
47:20
fifteen feet and the drop-off of the radiation goes roughly with depending on
47:26
where the antenna is pointing either with a distance or the distance squared you have significantly less radiation
47:33
when you're right at the foot of it than when you're like basically three feet away from it which is you'd have to
47:39
climb the pole basically to get to get up there and one thing that we are actually required to have the cellphone
47:47
carriers put in their application is that they have to put signage on the
47:53
pole itself warning of the RF so that if anybody were to have to go up there for
47:58
example if you're a utility worker and you're you have to do business you have to be up there and you're in proximity
48:05
they're there the warning signs and then you can have the you have you know the radio shut off in order that you can
48:11
safely do work up there but here but it's a good point and I just brought that as an example the house but it is
48:17
also governs people were walking by or we were outside you're like five feet
48:24
from it versus across the street it
48:31
drops off with the square of the distance so if you are you get a certain level of radiation when you're four feet
48:37
away if you're eight feet away you get one quarter of that and so on and so forth all right which case you are we
48:46
could pull up that slide for a moment I think in the distance that we're talking about on the shortest poles that we're
48:52
talking about here the pole itself is 14 feet and the idea is that you would add
48:59
five feet and the antenna is going to be probably at about 17 feet what this is
49:06
showing you is where you have one antenna when you get at least two point
49:14
three feet away and that's in any direction whether it's directly underneath whether it's at a 90 degree
49:21
angle off to the side once you get past that distance you can see that the
49:27
amount of frequency dissipates and it is less than you will have then carrying
49:33
the phone you on the walk if you were to put three antennas up there the distance would
49:41
have to be ten and a half feet now we made it so that the suggestion was in
49:48
the neighborhoods where you had particularly only had these 14-foot poles in order to fit into the
49:54
neighborhood we did not want to have more than an additional five feet it is
50:00
entirely possible if you wanted that we could have these things up higher and I will say that after the meeting tomorrow
50:06
all of these slides will be available to folks okay next next question one we
50:11
have one more how about in the gentleman the back with the beard yes I think the
50:21
weight should you say your name sorry my name is Kiera Soderbergh and the rezident and Germantown
50:26
I think the description of the delegation that went to represent us to
50:33
ask for more information about the safety is a good indication of the uncertainties involved if it's a safe if
50:40
it's as safe as a cell phone why are they all going out there to - to make this this call for more information
50:49
and in the light of the other things that have been said I noticed one of the
50:54
proposed cell phone towers is in my neighborhood right where I my kids wait
51:01
to be picked up at the at the library
51:07
what are our safeguards I guess and what can we what can we do to to ask for a
51:12
higher tower and that kind of a sensitive situation so the uncertainties so okay so couple
51:19
things on asking for a higher tower well that's one of the things that we're trying to work out is it feasible with
51:25
the tfcg to say so in this situation you bring like I know now I find out that
51:32
there's an application is it feasible to say is it possible to make that taller what we're trying to avoid is it can't
51:37
simply be is it possible not to put it in front of my house and to put it in my neighbor's house or is it possible to
51:42
put in front of you know the guy I don't like in the neighborhood never comes to the potlucks so so we're
51:48
we're trying to balance that out but it can be something that we can try to
51:54
handle on an individual basis one thing that I would note is some of the things
52:01
that when you have a lot of a lot of people have mentioned this about kids and elementary schools and waiting there
52:09
are a lot of parents who look at their devices and kids who look at their
52:15
devices while they're waiting for the bus my Department handles the Wi-Fi in
52:21
Montgomery County Public Schools with Montgomery County Public Schools and the
52:27
consumption that teenagers when they have an unlimited access to Wi-Fi is
52:34
enormous so part of the challenges that the that younger people parents of kids
52:42
are actually some of the folks that are driving the need in some cases why a
52:47
provider may come in and say I need to get more capacity in that area because I get a lot of users but I think
52:54
that on that kind of case I mean it might be something what we'd like to be able to look and see on a on a height is
52:59
there an engineering is there a reason for it one thing about the code though if we come in with the code and we say
53:05
the maximum you get is five feet in that type of situation it limits some of the
53:13
flexibility unless we move it to a different type of hearing but see me
53:19
I'll give you my card afterwards so talk to me about that specific one okay let me come down in front for one more RF
53:25
question and then I'm going to try to I'll take one more over here and then we'll move on
53:32
Mario Pasco I wanted to come back to your study have you in fact studied a
53:41
cumulative effect of RF we now
53:48
understand that the distance at the shortest you know possible distance to a
53:54
residential home will be 14 feet worst case scenario you know it will be the
54:00
equivalent of a cell phone at like ten feet and that will be
54:06
kind of right across from somebody's bedroom on the second or third floor but
54:12
people don't hold a cell phone for 24 hours 365 day of the year next day year
54:20
or even you know in at the distance so the question is you know have you ever
54:27
looked into the cumulative effect now that wasn't what we were asked to do and any right that's an open question and
54:33
again that's why I think you want to have real study conducted as is what miss her era said about this there what
54:44
we look there on so in an der you can weigh in on this right now there are not
54:51
federal studies that look to determine if I stand for one minute at something
54:57
that's ten times the power versus I stand for ten minutes with something that's 1 times the power
55:04
there there are no studies or things like that out there right now is that
55:11
correct I I think I haven't studied whether they're studies on that but and
55:16
I'm sure there's been a lot of research done on it but it hasn't been something that's been definitively there right
55:26
that's correct okay so let's okay so I I got it we're
55:32
gonna we're gonna cover some more RF questions we go over to here in the
55:37
corner hi Kerry Cunningham just quickly
55:47
if we want to let Susan hold the mic and show that spot if I understand this if I
55:52
understand this correctly you can have these towers within 20 feet of a bedroom
55:59
that has a child in its sleeping this includes yes this includes newborns
56:05
toddlers yes and all the time they sleep they're going to be there now well the
56:13
antenna will be there but Tanna is not necessarily on all the time
56:18
okay I just I just it's a little bit of hypothetical to put it out that I expect you to answer but when the class-action
56:24
lawsuits coming cust are coming in for the birth defects or the learning disabilities or the cognitive problems
56:31
because children are gonna be sleeping near these towers where we don't have studies that really show whether it's
56:36
safe or not how is that risk going to be managed that's all great so in these
56:48
cases the the owner and the operator of the antenna is the one that has the
56:54
liability for those and this isn't a I
56:59
mean as a legal opinion but the the federal statute right now says that we
57:04
may not make regulations on the basis of our concerns about the health effects of
57:11
RF okay so hold on let's let's try to I
57:17
will try to call on people but let's let's try to let each person have their
57:23
turn okay so under the Equal Protection Clause I don't think it's going to be the case where you can say that this
57:30
Telecommunications Act which allows them to just roll right through on eminent domain supersedes child's health and
57:36
safety that may have to be settled in the courts okay thanks
57:45
she disappeared okay there was a question oh yes did you want it did you
57:53
have a question okay wait wait for the microphone and say and say your name
58:00
when it comes thank you my name is Nancy Wallace I'm co-chair of the Montgomery
58:07
County Green Party was a candidate last year I've been on the board of directors of a an NGO a women's group working on
58:15
this issue for four years first of all I would like to clarify that section 704 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act does
58:22
not preempt on the basis of Health and Safety it mentions the word environment
58:28
that's all and the implied conflict preemption of one court system has in
58:36
fact brought that in so that it it sweeps it in in case of a possibility
58:42
that environment includes health and safety other other courts excuse me now
58:49
I'm gonna read the law I'm gonna read the law since you accused us of not telling the truth I'm gonna read the law
58:54
and everyone else can determine and
59:07
another court system in the US another circuit has in fact not gone along with
59:13
the implied conflict preemption so what I would like to to say tonight to the
59:19
people here and to the county executive office is I we would request we being
59:29
myself and others in the Green Party that are concerned about this it violates the Green Party's platform on
59:34
precautionary principle which means you don't roll out technologies and till there have been adequate studies and
59:45
there are about 10,000 scientific and medical studies now showing the harm of this type of radiation it's very clear
59:51
it's at bio initiative org among other other websites and every other Western
1:00:00
country and Israel are reducing their wireless they're taking it out of
1:00:06
schools in Israel it is now illegal to expose any child from 0 to 6 years of
1:00:11
age to any wireless in any school system and from 6 years to 12 years of age a
1:00:17
maximum of one hour per day this is a killer radiation and 5g the ultra high
1:00:22
frequency is the basis for the Department of Defense Active Denial system which is a Raygun you can look it
1:00:29
up in YouTube Active Denial system and that's what this is designed for in terms of the 5g infrastructure so what
1:00:36
we would like to request is that the county file a suit the Federal Communications Commission
1:00:43
requiring them to carry out their their
1:00:50
statutory authority to regulate this since they have refused for the last 20
1:00:56
years to look at any new medical studies they've refused the American Academy of Pediatrics request four years ago to
1:01:02
open the regulations and reevaluate and that we do not implement any additional
1:01:07
or any small cell technology in Montgomery County until that lawsuit has
1:01:13
reached its conclusion okay thank you okay I want to ask in the booth we could
1:01:19
put up slide 23 which has the federal restrictions on managing antennas
1:01:24
because there it has the language I want to let people know and if you do go to the website in January the county
1:01:32
executive when he sent a letter to the Commission asking them to address the RF
1:01:39
issues as an appendix all of the various studies that people had sent in to us
1:01:47
whether they were on rats they're in foreign studies there are other ones all those studies we included as an
1:01:54
attachment and we noted to the FCC that this is the problem of not exercising
1:02:01
leadership on this issue because there is other information out there and
1:02:06
that's why people are asking so this section here is is what it is and I did
1:02:15
say health effects and it is environmental effects of that Jerry did you have anything else that I'd like to
1:02:20
read the actual statute because I think we were told that you didn't say and
1:02:25
where what and if you want to take a note this is 47 USC 332 C 7 B little
1:02:34
four and it says no state or local government or instrumentality thereof
1:02:40
may regulate the placement construction and modification of a personal wireless
1:02:47
service facility on the basis of the environmental effects of radiofrequency
1:02:53
emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the Commission's regulations
1:02:59
concerning such emissions so I need to apologize to the lug to carry I guess it
1:03:06
is right for Nancy for my my reaction I just but we're we're we're not telling
1:03:13
stories here I mean this is a limitation and the gentleman's question is something that you're right that perhaps
1:03:18
the courts will resolve someday as to what's you know the primacy of the different rules but it's clear-cut that
1:03:26
if we're preempted courts have made it very clear that that that that's what the federal law would be primary now all
1:03:33
these other ideas are things that I you know that the county is pursuing we're
1:03:38
just trying to be as honest as possible as to what our limitations are and again I mean we represent lots of local
1:03:45
governments around the country not everybody has an engineering firm on staff that can help us try to make
1:03:52
decisions about well lots of folks don't want the towers being very tall but if
1:03:57
we can show that by making it taller we reduce the exposure level the chronic
1:04:03
exposure level that some folks are worried about I mean that's things that we're trying it we're trying to work within the parameters and we continue to
1:04:10
try to push the parameters to have the Commission do the job that it should do okay we we are at about almost at our
1:04:18
halfway point so let me take just a couple more questions and then I'd like to move on to other issues if we run out
1:04:25
of those questions we can come back to this issue okay so in the back of the room here in the brown sweater standing
1:04:31
up
1:04:38
thank you very much my name is Marcy Pollan I've testified at the FCC and I
1:04:43
can talk about that later I think it's a non-starter to invoke the FCC in this in this discussion quite frankly having had
1:04:50
personal experience there and having five people from the Commission approached me having not the slightest idea of the impact not only of 5g but a
1:04:57
4G or any of this technology okay let me try to paint you a brief picture if you
1:05:04
look at blood cells they should be round and individuated and flowing floating freely in the plasma right they have a
1:05:10
charge cellphones have a charge that's why cellphones are called cell phones I think because they work very similarly
1:05:17
they carry an electronic electromagnetic charge if that charge is disrupted that's the foundation of ill health okay
1:05:25
so 10,000 studies have been done on this issue they've been done for decades suppressed by industry which now
1:05:32
controls the state of California and that legislation has been passed now that prevents any kind of lawsuit
1:05:39
happening in the state of California that's gonna happen here because we're having a very civil and very manly discussion about a lethal technology
1:05:46
that's designed to have that level of impact in our lives when you start
1:05:52
putting these things on when these when these units are put up in the county or anywhere in this country this shatters DNA 5g technology will
1:06:00
shatter DNA and there's no curtain there's no wall that's gonna prevent that from happening there are no
1:06:05
subsidiary protections or issues that that we can discuss that's going to solve the problem on that level this is
1:06:11
just the reality of the situation and it's provable under the microscope if you look at blood under a microscope
1:06:16
within 15 minutes not even holding a cell phone for people who have you know
1:06:21
a lot of exposure to cell phone technology even just Wi-Fi in the house if you look 15 minutes after exposures
1:06:28
the blood cells begin to coagulate they begin to stick together and when they're stuck together they cannot transmit
1:06:34
oxygen or nutrients to the tissues and when the tissues are not being nourished then the organs become ill and then that
1:06:41
leads to a diagnosis you know symptoms and the diagnosis and treatment with women that's a whole other discussion but this is this is there there are no
1:06:49
there are no there's no middle ground in any of this okay quite frankly I think many of us are aware of that here okay in the
1:06:58
interest of time since we're reaching the halfway point what I'd like to focus on are there questions other than RF and
1:07:05
try to go around and do a few of those yes sir okay we can't up front Susan's
1:07:11
getting their steps in today but again I
1:07:16
will remind you we have about an hour left so I would ask you to please try to keep your questions short so that we can
1:07:23
get in as many as we can my name is Aaron Rosen swagg I want to
1:07:29
clarify the point about our hands being tied where we say that the federal law is clear that Montgomery County cannot
1:07:35
pass zoning laws that would have the effect of prohibiting service throughout the county it's a half-truth perhaps 50 percent
1:07:43
true it means we cannot outright ban wireless towers but as long as we treat
1:07:48
every cellphone company the same and have a clear set of zoning regulations we can still deny towers the most simple
1:07:55
example is that we should require poles that will break away when a car hits them almost all light poles are built
1:08:01
this way because it saves the life of the driver who hits one these new small cell towers have 300-pound antennas on
1:08:07
the top and are twice as tall as our light poles these poles must be hardened so they don't fall when hit by a car
1:08:14
basically they are designed to kill the driver our regulations require breakaway poles
1:08:19
we aren't outright banning 5g we just aren't willing to give up common-sense
1:08:24
safety for technology that is not ready
1:08:30
to say it another way as long as smart regulations are in place we can deny cell towers within their shot clock
1:08:36
period based on hard reasons strict residential neighborhood siting criteria
1:08:41
and the unlikely event the cell tower company unequivocally demonstrates that
1:08:46
there is no alternative to a residential neighborhood site meaning no feasible alternative location and a demonstrated
1:08:53
need then we must have a very strict siting and design criteria in short if
1:08:59
the installation is out of place in the neighborhood or can be recognized as a cell tower than it is unacceptable
1:09:06
. end of story no exceptions a cell tower in extra home will significantly lower its value as fewer people will be
1:09:14
willing to buy the home we must protect our neighborhoods it is unacceptable that our community's families take a
1:09:19
huge financial hit just so that a predatory company can increase their revenue well a significant gap does not
1:09:32
mean everyone has lightning fast 4G LTE downloads but there is reasonable access
1:09:38
to wireless service from the provider in cases where courts have found a significant gap exists thousands of people have poor or non-existent service
1:09:45
this means they can't make calls or establish a data connection not that they can't stream high-definition video
1:09:50
the law doesn't entitle the wireless industry to obtain competitive foothold to compete with Wired services because
1:09:57
that's what this is they are trying to place this in our neighborhoods position infrastructure and gain a competitive
1:10:02
advantage as a speculative business opportunity not to close a significant gap that is why they are here in
1:10:08
Montgomery County here in Palo Alto California and New York we are candy to the wireless industry
1:10:14
Aaron I'm going to become hard candy at one page one page okay that's fair all
1:10:27
right so a couple things on there first let's talk about the breakaway poles well at first let me sort of preface
1:10:32
this by also saying the zoning code is
1:10:38
parameters of what you are allowed to do it is not a and an author raishin
1:10:45
authorization that you can do it so for example if you have a house and the zoning code says you could replace it
1:10:53
and add a two-story house right it doesn't necessarily mean that oh the person who owns that I just get to go in
1:10:59
and take your house and replace it because the zoning code says I I can do that so in the same way the streetlights
1:11:06
are owned by month that are owned by Montgomery County about 17,000 of them
1:11:12
we owned about 20,000 we place on a utility pole owned by somebody else but where we own the streetlights we
1:11:18
actually in addition to the zoning code more authority to address it and i actually
1:11:24
have danced Anaya is in the back with the Department of Transportation and working on the breakaway issue in
1:11:30
particular and the specific language for that is most likely to happen in a separate agreement that a provider may
1:11:38
have if you want to use any of our property these would be specific requirements in addition one of the
1:11:44
things that we looked at about moving the equipment and saying that you would have the antenna the equipment there's
1:11:52
something called a Radiohead and what that does is it converts this wireless RF signal into an IP data packet and
1:12:01
Internet Protocol data packet and it goes through a piece of fiber in most cases the that equipment is what tends
1:12:09
to weigh more and so part of moving and saying that that equipment needs to be
1:12:15
at the base or at the ground level is moving it away from the issue of
1:12:21
somebody coming in to the pole and knocking down the pole so on the
1:12:26
breakaway issue that is something that we are trying to figure out and it's likely going to go into the licensing
1:12:33
agreement that the county has in addition on the standards things that we
1:12:38
own we have more ability to address that what we are likely to do is what we need
1:12:46
to do is to it's like when you're going you get business cards printed there's a certain set up charge and then after
1:12:52
that they all become cheaper it's the same thing with designing and making these poles so the feasibility that you
1:12:59
can come in well this one I want like this and this one I want like this makes it very difficult but for Montgomery County at the beginning to come and say
1:13:05
alright if you just the same way if you go on our website now and you want to see a street light you'll find the specs
1:13:11
for the six six different kinds of street lights we have and you'll find the specs for the six different kinds of luminaires that we have on there we are
1:13:17
looking to come up with the design in addition when we met with the Silver Spring urban advisory district part of
1:13:24
what they were also concerned was in that area is that they've been trying to add things where they can have banners
1:13:30
that may sit and there's room for that there may be other kinds of applications that they're interested in so we are
1:13:36
trying to accommodate and take all of those in but those will come in the licensing agreement for our specific
1:13:43
polls not in the zoning ordinance all right can I could we have another
1:13:48
question maybe we'll go right the woman in the denim with the glasses it's not
1:13:56
quite denim but it's denim colored hi my
1:14:07
name is Annette Nelson my question is it seems like a majority of people here are against this so what exactly can we do
1:14:13
to stop it from happening in our residential neighborhoods well so couple
1:14:23
things to think about we have a very large workforce that telecommute
1:14:29
probably one of every of the federal workforce of the active federal workforce who works in the DC area
1:14:36
probably 30% of them live in Montgomery County and they may telework one day a
1:14:42
week we have 25,000 businesses in Montgomery County that are one and
1:14:48
two-person consulting entities and when I worked in the cable office we had lots
1:14:54
of calls from people who have home-based businesses for whom they felt that I
1:14:59
cannot be without internet Aaron mentioned you will have and we say that
1:15:07
this this technology is it's it's new and it so in most cases if you have a
1:15:15
wireline provider a Comcast Verizon FiOS or RCN and then you may have a wireless
1:15:22
router in your house when you buy that package from them it may be that they
1:15:29
almost want to throw in the television service the video service for free so
1:15:34
maybe $70 have internet and it's $80 if you want to have cable for a long time
1:15:39
in the industry what people wanted to have was a triple play so they offer you a telephone and internet in a video so
1:15:46
you look at a provider not to call them out but you look at somebody like AT&T AT&T has a wireless cellular telephone
1:15:54
service they have bought DirecTV they
1:15:59
are now doing advertisements saying if you sign up for us with our phone plan you get DirecTV we'll give you a deal
1:16:06
AT&T may want to try to use this so that they could say I can offer you a
1:16:12
wireless cellular based 5g 4G service
1:16:17
that is as God as much capacity as that wireline service that you have coming to
1:16:23
your house now now that might mean for some consumers that there's new price
1:16:30
competition I will tend to say that in all the cases I've seen these in the past what tends
1:16:36
to happen is things are not offered at a lower price they tend to be that you get more I'll offer you more at the same
1:16:42
price so in some of these cases the problem is is that even when we had the
1:16:50
cell phones in the 1990s and lots of folks didn't want to have these we're
1:16:55
using more and more mobile data what
1:17:00
there are some providers it's a mixed bag some people are it's a business plan
1:17:06
speculation for other people they look at their current capacity and they see
1:17:11
that they have problems okay so the problems for the issue of if you don't
1:17:17
if you don't the it's a hard question because the because what we're trying to
1:17:23
balance is that we want Montgomery County to be the at the cutting edge of
1:17:29
technology we want our residents in attracting a new millennial base to come
1:17:35
and we want to have that service so in some cases we are looking for ways to
1:17:43
balance a way to have this in rather than to say no people showed up here
1:17:50
seem to be for the most part against this so what can we do okay so I'm gonna
1:17:56
ask that I want to hear what your question is so okay I'm gonna try to ask people to please not interrupt and let people
1:18:02
speak so most of us it seems like judging from the applause that most of us here are against this that we've
1:18:09
showed up to say that we're not for this technology and we're residents Lake County so what can we do to try to
1:18:15
prevent that from happening like what can happen with the zoning because if we can't think about it in terms of a health impact then how can we approach
1:18:21
that as a problem to fight against it so well what we're trying to do is to find
1:18:27
ways to make these things that they're compatible with in neighborhoods the County Executive will send over a zoning
1:18:35
ordinance and certainly it will be up to the County Council to approve it like
1:18:40
all legislation there will be a public hearing in which people can voice their
1:18:46
opposition or things that they would like to it but I can tell you that to be candid what we are trying to do is
1:18:53
to find a way that we can avoid the more
1:18:59
federal preemption we can avoid more federal or state impose that lets take
1:19:05
away local zoning and just say that you have to have whatever somebody comes in and wants to have and so what we are
1:19:12
trying to do is to work on find ways of how to make it compatible is there a way
1:19:19
to make it so that we just have it in business areas instead of residential areas because it seems like that's a
1:19:24
bigger issue for people it's having it in our neighborhoods okay so I'm gonna turn it over to to Jerry but but I do
1:19:31
want to say is that and I appreciate where you're coming from one of the things is we really are trying to make
1:19:37
more commercial properties available and I will tell you there's some providers
1:19:44
who are focused even Verizon Verizon has some things that they want to deploy in
1:19:49
downtown Silver Spring and they have some things that they want to employ in residential areas so there isn't it
1:19:56
isn't that we just have use in the commercial areas I'm going to turn it to Jerry sure I think the most important
1:20:03
thing that we all need to acknowledge is that the four of us have no votes
1:20:12
what we have been charged with is trying to come up with the the most protective
1:20:19
policy that the council can consider as a means to move forward and be
1:20:25
consistent the other thing that the council has seen is that around the country 13 states have passed laws that
1:20:35
would take away local government authority with respect to the deployment of small cells in the rights-of-way
1:20:41
there was one exception in the state of Arizona the City of Yuma was able to get
1:20:48
an exemption because they were grandfathered in and so that's a little bit also of what's happening here is is
1:20:56
our hope to come up with a with a program and a policy and again I mean so
1:21:01
that we get points like from Aaron you know that it's not that we don't want to
1:21:07
talk about RF but if there are things that non RF issues that we can change in
1:21:12
the policy that would make it more acceptable those are the types of comments that we're looking for and at
1:21:18
some point you know we're going to have to share this with the county executive and share with him
1:21:24
the issues that have been other that have arisen I assume that everyone in this room will be sharing with their
1:21:30
county council members their feelings on this and it'll be democracy in action
1:21:35
we're just doing the best that we can but we have no votes we have no votes but the other side is that there are
1:21:42
efforts there are efforts assure you do absolutely you do the there are efforts
1:21:48
underway where we're folks that aren't in Montgomery County whether they be in Annapolis or they be at the FCC are
1:21:55
looking to bypass our ability to do anything okay I'm gonna take a woman in
1:22:00
the green shirt in the middle on this side I'm sorry green jacket
1:22:10
someone's having fun out there oh thank you I'm Meredith Wellington I served
1:22:16
eight years on the Montgomery County Planning Board that determines all the zoning and my question is why can't you
1:22:22
make this use conditional in all parts of the county okay so the conditional
1:22:30
use would part of the issue is that it's one is it's a the kid the conditional
1:22:39
use would require that there is a zoning hearing for every one of these and so
1:22:49
all right so part of so part of it part of it is is a concern is that it would
1:22:55
be very difficult we have a hard time right now we have streamlined that process so that when you have a new
1:23:02
antenna to make the hundred and fifty day shot clock in the past two years
1:23:07
since we updated the zoning code we had two applications come in that manner it
1:23:15
would be very difficult for us to be able to manage that process where we would have a hundred of these
1:23:21
potentially pending and have a zoning hearing for each of them in addition
1:23:28
what the zoning hearing is designed to do is to determine if something is
1:23:33
compatible with the community so by setting up certain parameters and saying
1:23:39
if it's only five or ten feet taller than something that it's existing if
1:23:46
it's placed within two feet of something that's already there if it's attached to
1:23:51
a building the assumption is is that it is compatible with community use and
1:23:56
that allows us to process those applications more quickly and that reserves more time for the ones that are
1:24:04
more difficult for us to do excuse me mr. Meredith could I say one other thing
1:24:10
is I think a lot of people making the mistake that if it goes through a
1:24:15
conditional use that it will be turned down and that that isn't necessarily correct
1:24:21
I'll also what we're afraid of unless comment on this is that if if it
1:24:28
if the shot clock runs then it's it is allowed by right and that's that's
1:24:35
that's a problem so therefore we're trying to thread this needle by trying
1:24:41
to just find a way that we can make these more compatible with the
1:24:47
neighborhoods and not a proliferation and that I think that's what we're
1:24:54
trying to do and because the conditional use could allow these these towers to go
1:25:01
in just by right because you don't have the resources to hold the hearings right
1:25:06
but the reason they could go by right is you would miss the time deadlines and you wouldn't be able to hold the hearing
1:25:13
in time well certain certain certain things for for antennas in which there's
1:25:19
an antenna that's there now and you want to swap it out Congress mandated that we
1:25:25
may not deny those and the FCC took that to say well swapping something out and
1:25:33
they made it much larger because they were really thinking of much taller antennas the thing that actually
1:25:38
concerns me is if you look at the federal government and the various budget and the things these are the
1:25:45
kinds of situations where you tend to have these must pass bills and things
1:25:50
get attached and that piece of we must approve all of these these antenna
1:25:56
modifications was attached to the middle-class tax relief act that had to
1:26:02
get passed so part of this is and that's why I put out there is this other
1:26:07
legislation is that one of the things that we really are trying to address is if it takes a hundred and fifty days for
1:26:15
all of these things it creates more friction for at the FCC and the bedeck
1:26:22
this is an agency again that has not completed as proceeding in four years that is actively looking to say is
1:26:29
ninety days too long and that should be shortened to thirty and the county executive made this point with the
1:26:36
chairman of the FCC see that by shortening those shot clocks you are precluding the possibility of
1:26:43
having public hearings because you cannot get enough notice hold the
1:26:48
hearing and do the report within those periods of time so part of what we're trying to do are define the situations
1:26:55
where we can find some bright-line standards say that these would be compatible and to leave the other ones
1:27:01
that may be more difficult for for a different one let me move to the gentleman in the green shirt I just want
1:27:07
to say one more thing which is I realize we can't write this legislation here tonight and it is complicated and I'm
1:27:12
sure the county is working as hard as it can to protect citizens but the zoning tool to address this is to look at
1:27:20
having more situations more areas of the county where it's a conditional use and you might want to just do that in the
1:27:26
neighborhoods in the residential neighborhoods make it a conditional use it already exists as a conditional use
1:27:34
so I mean that it's not a matter that we need to make more if you if you don't
1:27:39
fit in the parameters that we lay out currently right now which is attaching
1:27:45
to a building attaching to an existing structure your remedy is to go and get a conditional use so that exists now the
1:27:53
issue is are there more things that we would move in place as limited use the gentleman in the green shirt my name is
1:28:06
al Hemi today thank you for holding this hearing I'm an Army veteran a doctor and
1:28:11
an ex engineer my question is why if
1:28:18
there's problem with service and I understand I used to work at the Pentagon
1:28:24
people like to telework why not use voice over IP because for most providers
1:28:31
once you get near your router you'll get your actually your cell phone should be
1:28:38
able to switch over to voice over IP and then that's one thought and my second
1:28:44
question is really repeating what all my basically neighbors
1:28:51
here essentially are asking we appreciate the fact that this is a
1:28:58
difficult task to deal with I do realize that the FCC's Chairman is an ex Verizon
1:29:04
legal counsel so however what we are asking is we feel
1:29:14
passionate about this how would you or the chairman of FCC feel if they somebody were to held a
1:29:21
cell phone - they're basically next to the net next to their children's head
1:29:26
24/7 we feel that kind of passion I feel that about my children about my
1:29:31
neighbors children about all these people here so how can we fight them
1:29:37
thanks okay so a couple things a couple things on that one it I would
1:29:44
always say candidly we need to find more Republican allies on Capitol Hill and we need to find more
1:29:50
industry allies to talk with the FCC somebody made the point that the FCC is
1:29:56
not a health agency and they themselves will say that and they will say that's why it's very hard for us because we
1:30:02
have to talk to these other agencies of which I would say well they're all in Montgomery County I mean certainly you
1:30:07
can do it but you're but the issue is is that the the FCC is the entity that's
1:30:16
charged with doing it and to get them to move I think that we need to find more
1:30:24
persuasive and industry now I will say that from the industry that the
1:30:29
president of the wireless Industry Association agrees that the FCC these
1:30:34
are the people who who build the build the towers and not the carriers providing the service but they're the tower builders their trade association
1:30:40
they agrees that the FCC needs to complete this proceeding and he's
1:30:48
willing to go with us to meet with the FCC we are working with our legislative office to see can we find other
1:30:53
Republican members and most of you know there's only one Republican member in Maryland but there are some other ones
1:31:00
particularly in Virginia so we're looking to try to find can we find some other voices
1:31:05
that say to the commission that you need to address this on the the first part of
1:31:15
your question I can't quite recall voice-over-ip okay so this one quick issue about this
1:31:22
the the federal statutes since at least 96 and a little bit before then have
1:31:30
basically taken the position that what
1:31:35
we need to do is eliminate regulation eliminate consumer protections and
1:31:41
expand competition because that way if people don't like it in one thing they
1:31:47
can just go to something else I'm not suggesting that I think that works I'm just saying is that that is the basis
1:31:53
for a decision after decision that overturned or that limited what local
1:31:59
governments can do so in that case it was entirely the case when people said
1:32:05
well I have Comcast in my house why do I need to have Verizon come and dig up my
1:32:11
yard so that you can offer me something else which is the same thing that Comcast is providing why do I need a
1:32:19
cellphone I have a landline telephone and it works great in my house there's
1:32:25
lots of examples why do we need to have satellite dishes that sit on people's
1:32:31
houses because you're perfectly capable of either getting over-the-air broadcast or cable television so we just have a
1:32:38
long history and that the law is set up that it is designed that it's looking
1:32:46
for competition under the premise that it will benefit consumers because you'll
1:32:52
either get lower prices or you'll get more robust service offerings all right let me go to the gentlemen in the back
1:32:59
with the white golf cap hat now I'll come back over on
1:33:04
that side daddy my workout tonight yes first of
1:33:12
all I'd like to thank oh my name is Mark Malamud I live in North Potomac in the
1:33:18
Wesley neighborhood first of all I'd like to thank you for your patience and
1:33:24
your commute your continued struggle in our behalf I recognize I've not always been that
1:33:34
understandable and understanding in my questioning in the past and I apologize for any impatience I've shown I do want
1:33:43
to ask two questions because we've seen a lot of slides in the past few meetings
1:33:51
are we going to see a slide that will show us the current cell phone coverage
1:33:58
as it exists in our area that's number
1:34:03
one and and then projected Maps for the
1:34:08
future and then number two we have a neighborhood that's not far from us that
1:34:14
has one large like 93 foot Tower or something like that and since the Wesley
1:34:21
neighborhood is targeted for I don't know dozen or two towers why can't we
1:34:27
have one large Tower in our neighborhood in one of the green spaces of which we
1:34:32
have plenty and that should alleviate Leigh some of the concerns of proximity
1:34:40
and the inverse-square law will allow us to feel more comfortable by distance
1:34:45
from the radiation etc okay thank you thanks for the and if we can pull up
1:34:50
slide 17 okay so on the first issue of
1:34:55
can we get a map that's showing the coverage we can try to work on something like it
1:35:00
the issue with that is what it is not showing is capacity so in the past when
1:35:08
you had cell phones the service was on or you would notice that you'd have a dropped call now when you look at
1:35:15
capacity what tends to happen is you have things where they slow down so you may have a webpage that comes on your
1:35:21
phone but then it takes a while for all the pictures to load or you have a video and it takes a
1:35:27
while to go ahead and buffer so that is a little bit harder because the capacity
1:35:32
is also driven by if you have certain roads where you have a lot of people who are there at rush hour so they have a
1:35:39
lot of devices and they may be using GPS streaming music the kids are watching something so those can all that's a
1:35:45
little bit trickier this slide here is showing you rough roughly and if we go
1:35:52
back one slide okay so a 100-foot Tower
1:36:01
roughly has a radius of about a mile a
1:36:07
700 a to a 20 foot Tower roughly has a radius of about 750 feet those two
1:36:16
things are capable of providing the same amount of capacity so you could say is
1:36:23
that instead of building we can go to the next slide instead of building 57
1:36:28
new small antennas I could go ahead and build 57 tall antennas and potentially
1:36:36
get there the issue is two things really one is that the targeted approach that
1:36:44
you might have is I don't need coverage everywhere where I need it can be in
1:36:49
certain pockets those pockets can also exist because of topography we have
1:36:55
Hills and we have valleys and we have very tall trees and all of those things
1:37:02
on a case-by-case basis can make a difference some people would like them in open spaces some people would like to
1:37:09
make sure that we don't have them in open spaces on the so and and the issue
1:37:16
is is that there are the last issue is is that 5g is really is two things it's
1:37:24
a tool you can take the the the way that 5g is roughly working is I'm putting a
1:37:31
device closer to the antenna and that allows me to take spectrum and to take information and
1:37:39
it's going like this and the faster that I can hand off and deliver that I can reuse that spectrum and that's what a
1:37:45
provider is using to get more capacity as you have more people who are streaming Netflix watching those things
1:37:52
cutting off and not using Wi-Fi to connect those but connecting to some other plan that can impact it there are
1:37:58
other so you can take what we call 4G technology and you can use 5g tools and
1:38:06
turn it into 5g in addition there's new spectrum and I think people mentioned it
1:38:11
that's coming out that's because of you if you've seen the auctions those of you when you had a digital television we've
1:38:17
had to move it if some of you have noticed some PBS stations and in selling it all this is part of the federal
1:38:22
government kind of moving things around to make more spectrum available one of the things that they're looking to do is to make spectrum available that doesn't
1:38:29
travel as far so you could have a provider that says I don't have the ability to use a hundred-foot tower
1:38:36
because I don't own the spectrum that travels a mile I only own or have more
1:38:42
capacity in this spectrum that travels something like 750 feet okay I'm gonna
1:38:47
move to the veteran in front yes sir
1:39:00
anything my name is Mark King I'm from Germantown Maryland I'm not interested in zoning I'm not interested in how high
1:39:07
the tower is as a military guy combat arms officer in the United States Army I
1:39:13
recognize when I can't generate enough combat power to overcome the enemy so here's what I'd like to see the the
1:39:22
these towers and I happen to be the proud recipient of one right on my front lawn is that I have concluded that there
1:39:34
is a reason to be concerned about the value of my property once his tower is
1:39:39
installed and I suspect it will be installed so what I would like to see
1:39:45
I'd like to find out if the county has the ability to cause a fund to be
1:39:50
created by the cell to cell tower companies that requires the establishment of a fund for let's say 1
1:39:57
cent for every dollar collected for the operation of towers this phone would be used to compensate homeowners and
1:40:03
conversely could compensate health issues and other issues that arise from this throughout the county who lose
1:40:10
value in the property because of the close proximity of a small cell tower the details of such fund operations
1:40:15
could be worked out later there's no question in my mind that after discussing the issue with a number of
1:40:21
realtors in the area that this will affect home property values mostly to the negative and there's plenty of
1:40:26
anecdotal evidence on the internet that would support that claim as well as such I believe that the county has the
1:40:32
responsibility to establish the permitting criteria for the installation of these small towers then the county
1:40:37
bears the responsibility to protect homeowners throughout the county ensuring that their property values will
1:40:43
not be negatively impacted by these actions so I ask can the county require
1:40:49
the cellphone companies to establish a real estate compensation fund to ensure homeowners throughout the county are
1:40:55
financially protected from a reduction in value of their property as a result of this action
1:41:06
that that is something that we would have to further research and probably the most important factor in that is
1:41:15
that Congress passed the not taxing of
1:41:22
wireless services the internet Tax Freedom Act so the internet Tax Freedom
1:41:27
Act says that you cannot tax Internet serve provision of Internet service the
1:41:35
issue is for a telecom provider right now the wireless telephone service that
1:41:42
you if you purchase that is subject to I believe it's a three dollar and fifty
1:41:48
cent tax that the county imposes per line on that service the mobile wireless
1:41:55
service I think it would be difficult to impose something you'd have to reach
1:42:01
this what I'm saying you have to research it because it comes down to the issue of is it a tax of general
1:42:06
applicability or does it become some kind of fee that could be justified and that that would require more analysis on
1:42:14
that but what I would also add is the issue of what drives a home value up or
1:42:21
down or certain things is a complicated and it's typically not easy to isolate
1:42:26
that it's one factor so just in the application of it it can be difficult the other piece is that there are also
1:42:34
studies that show and you can see them as well when you see renters and apartment that access to Internet
1:42:41
service is an important thing access to fiber in some cases there have been some
1:42:46
studies out there that show that those improved home values so it's a balance
1:42:51
I think definitely between the aesthetics but also that there are
1:42:56
people who are going to be looking for places where they can get service okay
1:43:02
let me go ahead and take the women right here in the next mark
1:43:16
hold on a second thank you for having this meeting because you repeat your
1:43:21
name one more time a sack line and I do appreciate how complicated this this is
1:43:26
and I do hope there's more of you working on this because it's requires quite a task for us
1:43:32
I wanted to ask you about some strategy questions and I guess I'm speaking for
1:43:38
the little people the kids on whom RF radiation has never been tested I think
1:43:45
it's important to point that out that the testing was only done on us facsimile of a 220 pound mail therefore
1:43:52
we only know if it's safe within a certain proximity of a big guy so as far
1:43:58
as young people can you talk to me about exploring setback ordinances many
1:44:04
communities throughout the country have instituted 2,500 foot setback ordinances
1:44:09
for any kind of cell facility until such time as it is proven safe for kids which
1:44:16
I'm sure it won't be because it's not ethical to test this sort of thing on a child and then the other strategy
1:44:24
question would be compliance The Wall Street Journal article in 2014 there was
1:44:30
a report that said one out of every ten facilities was out of compliance with the FCC regulations FCC said we simply
1:44:39
don't have the resources to check all of the towers so I guess my question is for the legal expert how do you write in
1:44:46
caveats that say until such time as for the set for the safety and then for the
1:44:53
compliance can you have them require that the the sites are tested daily I
1:44:58
mean can you set up some barriers that help us keep these away from our homes
1:45:08
police are all terrific questions I would I would ask you if you had a slight to what communities have a 2500
1:45:16
foot setback III think my firm actually
1:45:22
represents Walnut Creek we have an office in Walnut Creek and that's not my understanding that's not a broad across
1:45:28
the board a setback requirement but I will look at that and share that with with the county your your second
1:45:36
question well again going back to the RF again I I can only tell you that the
1:45:43
elected leadership of this county has been to the Commission and plans to continue to push the Commission to get
1:45:49
answers for those questions and to the extent that we can will address it within the within the powers of the law
1:45:56
I mean there okay so let me let me address and and I'm gonna ask again just
1:46:01
remind people to try not to shout it because what happens is that we can't we can't pick up the question the question
1:46:07
was about riding in caveat sir can we do that the issue is is that there are some
1:46:12
jurisdictions where they have looked and they said they have to be farther from schools that have to be farther from nursing homes have to be farther through
1:46:18
his other areas but in what we were looking at it also seemed that those
1:46:23
were also places where there were a lot of people who wanted to be able to use
1:46:28
their devices so we have not I mean so
1:46:34
so we have looked and we are aware of those but we have not opted to choose those on the issue of are there other
1:46:42
people I can tell you that besides these people yes there are many other people in the county in multiple agencies and
1:46:49
zoning who are trying to weigh in on this and we're trying to figure out all the different permutations of it I'm
1:46:57
gonna come I know it but if I could just throw a thing and just to the question
1:47:02
of compliance that's something that we take very seriously every single one of the applications and the sites is
1:47:09
reviewed very closely for um you know what is what is the level of radiation coming out of it what is the pattern
1:47:15
where does it go and is it in compliant with the FCC rules granted it's the FCC rules but in this case you mentioned
1:47:23
seventy-five percent this is a hundred percent as far as the review and the thoroughness on it and it's one of the
1:47:28
things that the county has made sure is is very closely watched I will also add
1:47:34
that following last October's meeting that we did go out and do site visits to
1:47:39
look at the compliance in the field and those antennas were in compliance and we
1:47:44
can look at finding ways to make that data more available I'm going to come down in front and I want to give us a
1:47:50
note that we have about 18 minutes so
1:47:57
Anna Mae yes hey that it is this is a live television so we're going to stop it at the at 9 o'clock my name is Jerry
1:48:05
Goss and I'm speaking on behalf of the 7 lakhs Civic Association Inc one of our major concerns is the additional weight
1:48:12
on the existing wooden poles many of them are 50 60 or 70 years old we see
1:48:17
that tonight there's a forecast of gusty winds and heavy rain gusts of 30 to 50
1:48:23
miles an hour they say scattered tree and power line outages how many more power line poles
1:48:29
will fall we saw that a loss of electricity in most of Puerto Rico now
1:48:34
with more than 80 or 85 percent without electricity we don't want this to happen in our County you can't keep adding
1:48:40
weights of fiber optic lines of telephone lines of cable lines you keep
1:48:45
adding weight these poles can't take it unless we have some new requirements to say that the poles will be tested
1:48:52
50-year old poles can't take an additional couple hundred pounds on there we have serious problems with our
1:48:58
old poles they've never been replaced thank you all right okay so let me let me answer that the
1:49:06
the issue there is is that right now when it goes through the transmission facilities coordinating group tfcg or
1:49:13
the tower committee they look to determine that everything that is being
1:49:19
attached will meet the current wind safety ratings I believe those are at
1:49:24
the G stand or the rev G standard and they have to be and I it's either 75 or
1:49:30
90 miles an hour is what they have to be able to withstand there is a site visit that goes out to each of these areas so
1:49:37
if there was an issue in which you might have a poll that looks like it needed
1:49:43
some issue they they could require that there be a structural analysis to determine that it could hold it in the
1:49:50
case of utility poles those poles are also managed and owned by the utility
1:49:56
company and typically the utility companies themselves have had requirements where you may have to
1:50:02
replace a pole if you're adding more lines and they don't think it can hold the weight or if you are adding
1:50:07
additional equipment so there's a couple different checks of people who are looking to make sure that that happens
1:50:13
I'm gonna go to the myths I just have to take a point of personal privilege and that is I'm a member of the seven locks
1:50:18
and I'm proud to have you here representing us good evening I'm Megan
1:50:34
Montgomery I'm a resident of Montgomery County and I to thank you for holding this hearing it really seems like we're
1:50:40
looking for a solution that does not have a problem I have been telecommuting
1:50:45
for a number of years I used to own a consulting firm I have never ever heard anyone say they can't move to Montgomery
1:50:53
County for lack of internet access service now I would I would also like to
1:51:02
note that there is absolutely nothing that we have heard here tonight compelling the county to act in any
1:51:08
manner on this issue right now today and we have heard no evidence at all that
1:51:14
the county's actions are going to do anything to slow or stop the potential
1:51:21
threat of future regulations from the state or the feds this is just simply
1:51:27
the government showing up at our doorstep going I'm from the government and I'm here to help and that scares
1:51:34
people to death so I would really urge the county to consider either spending
1:51:41
this effort and obvious lots of people time and and money and
1:51:47
and and you know and resources to to better empower the council to to affect
1:51:57
the will of the people that are sitting here tonight okay so a couple one one
1:52:04
let me let me take one one point of addresses we have met with the industry and addressing particularly in the state
1:52:10
of Maryland because what you see is both with in the history of cable franchising
1:52:16
and telecom taxes and in the small cell regulation and preemption area what
1:52:24
tends to happen is is that you see industry moving to preempt at the state
1:52:30
level because they haven't had as much I mean nothing's really getting done in Congress that much so they've moved to
1:52:37
the states so what we are concerned about is the maryland legislative
1:52:42
session opens again in january industry yes can't come to us we I mean frankly I
1:52:50
think there's two things happening I think that one in the past we've done a good job of organizing on various things
1:52:56
and and educating our delegation and working with other areas I think that you also have a certain number of rural
1:53:04
Delic delegates from rural areas who are starting to recognize that if you just
1:53:09
preempt what montgomery county in prince george's county can do that doesn't necessarily mean that wireless services
1:53:16
are going to come to the other areas but that said if the industry can come back
1:53:22
and say look preemption at the state level is needed because we've worked in
1:53:28
montgomery county for a year and we cannot reach any kind of local solution
1:53:35
it lends more fodder to the idea that pre-empting local governments is the
1:53:44
solution and that's what we are trying to work towards avoiding but but all of
1:53:49
us in montgomery county standing here waiting to be slaughtered to prove to some rural county that
1:53:56
we may have a solution that involves us being literally I'm sorry I'm that's not
1:54:04
what I intended and if that's if that's the issue you know what a simple what I'm simply saying is there are some in
1:54:11
various federal filings and things that you see you will see industry filings
1:54:17
which say we have to preempt local zoning so that we can bring broadband to
1:54:23
all Americans and we filed comments saying that that is a deeply disingenuous premise to suggest that if
1:54:31
you preempt urban areas that's suddenly going to mean that you're going to have
1:54:36
wireless services in rural areas but what they are counting on is that the
1:54:41
one place that you are likely to see more broadband legislation in Congress
1:54:47
is specifically focused on rural so it's a marketing pitch in which they've
1:54:53
talked about it that way what I'm simply saying is that the Maryland level why we haven't seen legislation that was
1:55:01
introduced last time maybe in part because rural delegates know that just
1:55:09
pre-empting in urban areas is not necessarily going to lead to a boon in
1:55:14
those areas but again what we are trying to do is to have a a strategy in which
1:55:22
we are proactively looking to see how can we manage and have compatible
1:55:31
deployment in our neighborhood how can we find ways in which we meet the
1:55:36
federal shot-clock requirements without pre-empting the ability for people to
1:55:42
have say particularly where we have new antennas in there all right I'm gonna move to the gentlemen state level let us
1:55:50
go to Annapolis and fight there okay don't bring it to Montgomery County all
1:55:55
right thank you okay so again we have about 11 minutes so I'm gonna move to the
1:56:01
gentleman in the back in the red shirt
1:56:11
name is Dan Kaiser just like quick question so for these cell tower deployments are
1:56:19
guesses - deployments directs antenna distributed antenna systems they're
1:56:25
pretty much so in Montgomery County the probably about 500 feet from each other every pound your feet they'll be an
1:56:31
antenna in Montgomery County that's the end goal okay so it so here's a couple
1:56:37
things it say it depends it because these the different providers it's my
1:56:46
belief and from our conversations with them that they're each trying out different models they don't have a fixed
1:56:54
set so in some cases you'll have one provider who says I want to try using a - network for somebody else you're gonna
1:57:01
say I want to find a way to get more coverage in a dense area like Silver Spring or Bethesda so it is not a
1:57:07
uniform it is likely that as we move to
1:57:13
having more things like self-driving vehicles and other types of okay but but
1:57:20
as you have other types of applications which become very dependent on I have to track something and never lose track of
1:57:27
it you might see some of those types of things but it's not clear whether that's
1:57:33
the only solution or whether some of these other ones be a mix like say for example yes North Potomac 21 towers I
1:57:41
believe - towers the past are the measure of their share towers or their
1:57:48
6061 in North Potomac I'm not sure those are all share towers or they're all dedicated so in most cases in that area
1:57:55
they are shared and they will encompass more different more than one provider it's possible that Verizon for example
1:58:03
can have their own Tower if they pass the hypothetical communities Israel so
1:58:09
so part of the issue is in the past when we had taller antennas we mandated
1:58:15
colocation the issue is on the smaller poles is that if you mandate colocation
1:58:22
more things than you and may end up with larger equipment it it is yes most
1:58:30
likely going to be a mix because the other thing is some providers own
1:58:36
spectrum that travels very far distances and other providers own spectrum that
1:58:42
travels a shorter distance so depending on who it is I'll give you one more quick follow-up there North Potomac
1:58:50
would have more than 61 cell towers either - shared standalone
1:58:55
small cell it's possible I mean some of
1:59:03
these anything is possible but what is feasible 80 percent of the applications
1:59:08
that we have coming into the county for wireless antennas are from the four major carriers so when you reach a point
1:59:15
where you either have all four carriers have that coverage or you have a provider in which they're not
1:59:21
particularly they don't see any coverage capacity issues yes it's theoretically possible there may be more things that
1:59:26
are built there but it's not that likely unless something else changes okay I'm gonna say that in the in okay so I'm
1:59:33
Minich I'm gonna cut that one off and so we've got about seven minutes what I'm going to ask is is there anybody here
1:59:39
who has not come to a previous community meeting who has a question all right let
1:59:49
me go to the gentlemen in the front here my name is Gary Charlie and I live in
1:59:55
Park overlook I have a question as to whether we can protect ourselves if we feel threatened by this radiation for
2:00:00
whatever reason whether we think is rational and someone else doesn't can we for instance put up a reflector 10 feet
2:00:07
from the pole or 5 feet from the pole that's a 17 feet off the ground and protect our homes and the children in
2:00:12
them and the people that live there I'm gonna ask Lord can be insists that that the pole in front of our house be directional and whatever's inside that
2:00:19
equipment point away from our homes so again that that's part of I remember
2:00:26
that when Missy was going through the categories of things that are going to be requested one of them is why she
2:00:32
picked this location and so for and that's one of the things that we'd be looking at like so if you have this
2:00:37
here you had a playground you've got other other sorts of things like that it's definitely something that we want
2:00:42
to understand why it was why it was placed there or not not someplace else as far as what you personally could put
2:00:48
up if you want to put up mylar in your house or whatever whatever it is that you want to do I mean I these are all
2:00:54
things that are permitted I mean I don't I don't know I don't you you it's not
2:01:00
illegal to put things up to keep the signal from coming in it would be illegal to try to interrupt the signal
2:01:06
so you couldn't do a cell phone jammer that there's been litigation on that I
2:01:11
mean it's it's so ridiculous that a number of a number of jails tried to use
2:01:17
cell phone jammers and they were found to be violating the rules you know so I mean yes some some of the some of the
2:01:24
results are ridiculous okay
2:01:32
North Potomac I live in the Wesley neighborhood in North Potomac and there
2:01:37
is a cell tower proposed about five feet from my front yard my kids play there every day and there's
2:01:44
also a popular community walkway that's three feet from that tower where people dozens of people walk on that path daily
2:01:51
two questions one is we've been talking about you've been using that phrase about a we cannot prohibit service to
2:01:58
the area but right now we already have service in our North Potomac our Wesley community we're not prohibiting any
2:02:04
service by denying these 5g towers we already have excellent service according to Verizon by their coverage map so you
2:02:11
keep using that argument saying oh we can't do anything about it because it's we're prohibiting that service but we're not so I would suggest the tower
2:02:18
Committee push back to Verizon and cache crown castle and say hey why don't you look for other places are really
2:02:25
underserved underserved Peter yeah who wants to put the tower up you
2:02:32
automatically said that you have good service from Verizon or is it Verizon
2:02:37
that's asking yes the tower committee needs to push back to your to the
2:02:43
industry and say hey why don't you do with more thorough research and give us other communities that really need these
2:02:49
towers because right now in a more North Potomac we're at an affluent neighborhood I think most people have
2:02:54
very good internet service already 4G and broadband so I think you guys are
2:03:00
just using this argument all week we can't do anything about it because it's were prohibit but we're not prohibiting it if we deny it in these in this look
2:03:07
at least in our North Potomac okay yeah so let me so let me kind of try to address that the issue about digital
2:03:17
equity is is an important one right now the when we had cable franchising local
2:03:26
governments in the statute allowed us to say that eventually you have to serve everyone and the telecom law was set up
2:03:34
distinctly different in which it was well let the industry go out and serve and it'll be great
2:03:39
so we don't have the same tools in which we may say we can look at in our
2:03:47
analysis if we look and we identify places or more likely that we have complaints from people about areas that
2:03:55
can be something that we may go to industry and ask what are you doing in this area but it tends not to be
2:04:01
something that we say well why don't you not do this and go someplace else right now I don't believe our County to
2:04:08
committee is doing the due diligence and pushing back on these technical requirements there really is a
2:04:14
significant gap regarding we're going
2:04:21
back to what your comment earlier about the feed property evaluation you said it's hard to pin down
2:04:27
well Department of Housing and Urban Development states that cell towers affect property they require certified
2:04:34
appraisers to take the presence of nearby cell towers into consideration when they appraise our property the
2:04:39
guidelines that the HUD they categorize cell towers as hazards and nuisances and
2:04:45
there's writing that says the HUD prohibits FHA the Federal Housing Authority underwriting of mortgages for
2:04:51
homes that are within the engineered fall zone of a cell tower so there's there's obvious but language saying that
2:04:59
you buzz okay one last question but I'm gonna address
2:05:06
that and say and I want to address that and say that we will okay we we will we
2:05:12
will take a look at that but what I will also say is that those cell towers and things that they are talking about are the macro towers in most cases that we
2:05:19
were talking about so let me go because we've only got a couple minutes left I'm gonna try to get another question right
2:05:24
here in the gray hi my name is Jenna art
2:05:31
I've been a resident of Montgomery County for 17 years 17 years ago I came
2:05:37
from Russia where freedom and the respect of private property etc is
2:05:43
non-existent so I was under the impression that our private property is
2:05:48
sacred right isn't that correct isn't it you know well it's not is there a question
2:05:55
in there yes there is there are ways in which we it's not an
2:06:00
absolute right okay so electromagnetic fields is the new smoking okay
2:06:06
it is very harmful we don't know this yet okay 50 years ago doctors used to
2:06:11
advertise camel okay it has to be perfectly healthy so in about 50 years
2:06:17
when we finally realize how dangerous and how harmful electromagnetic fields
2:06:22
are it's gonna be too late we already have a lot of people every other person has an autoimmune disease in this
2:06:28
country what is happening I mean we can't be around electromagnetic fields 24/7 this is this is ridiculous I don't
2:06:36
use microwave my cell phone has a special case that prevents electromagnetic radiation okay I turn
2:06:42
off my router every single night and I work from home I'm actually in IT I'm a
2:06:48
web developer so I work from home and so does my husband and we are perfectly fine the way that things are we have
2:06:54
perfect internet connection but you guys are driving us away from this county you said that you want to bring young
2:07:00
professionals here you're driving us away we are starting to the properties in Frederick County because we can stay
2:07:06
here alright and we we have we have a beautiful house your honor and we have to sell it ASAP because we
2:07:13
are scared that we're going to lose property value and we're gonna get even sicker okay all right I appreciate your
2:07:20
comments I'm gonna have one last question the gentleman in the blue blazer and I think that's the last one I think we have about 90 seconds weren't
2:07:26
about just about Thank You Missy melt all from Montgomery Village and I
2:07:32
commend you for addressing this through zoning there are other levels in the
2:07:38
county code as you said the construction codes and in fact operating rules
2:07:44
through a variety of things and as you get to adding on those layers after
2:07:51
dealing with this and I understand there's a bit of futility sense about
2:07:56
this is going to happen but are we going to do any monitoring the county's been
2:08:03
monitoring air pollution water pollution things like that over the years when you
2:08:09
have WSSC checks the water out of your tap in a swimming pool they check the
2:08:16
pollution almost hourly what's the county going to do about okay so Amy
2:08:22
there's a time I'm gonna say that that is a fair question and that we should look to see can we do some type of
2:08:28
monitoring or compliance and look to see what the feasibility of that I want to thank everybody for coming out again you
2:08:35

2:08:41
